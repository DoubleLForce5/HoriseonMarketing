# Horiseon Marketing 

## Description 

Refractored Horiseon Marketing's website by editing their website's codebase in a way that follows accessibilty standards in an effort to optimize the site for search engines.  

## How did I accomplish this you ask? 

First I adjusted the HTML by adding semantic elements in place of the generic ones in the original codebase. 
for example I: 
  - Added a `<header>` element 
  - Wrapped navigation links in a `<main>` element 
just to name a few. 

I reworked the structure of the HTML to assure all elements followed a logical structure. then alt attributes were added to the images on the page in an effort to further aid in accesibility. 

Changed a few heading attributes to assure they fall in sequental order on the page and wrapped the companies name in the title element. 

In regards to the external style sheet I consolidated and organized the CSS selectors and properties. I also adjusted the structure of the style sheet to mirrore that of the HTML. For more detail please see the external style sheet as comments were added for clarity.

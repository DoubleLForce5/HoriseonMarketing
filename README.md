# Horiseon Marketing 

## Description 

Refactored Horiseon Marketing's website by editing their website's codebase in a way that follows accessibility standards to optimize the site for search engines. 

## How did I accomplish this you ask? 

First I adjusted the HTML by adding semantic elements in place of the generic ones in the original codebase. for example I:
  - Added a `<header>` element 
  - Wrapped navigation links in a `<main>` element 
just to name a few. 

I reworked the structure of the HTML to assure all elements followed a logical structure. then alt attributes were added to the images on the page to further aid in accessibility.

Changed a few heading attributes to assure they fall in sequential order on the page and wrapped the company's name in the title element.

In regards to the external style sheet, I consolidated and organized the CSS selectors and properties. I also adjusted the structure of the style sheet to mirror that of the HTML. For more detail please see the external style sheet as comments were added for clarity.
